# Rumbl

This application allows us to record videos (hosted elsewhere) and attach comments to them in real time as well as play them along with comments from other users.

At scale, this application will be tremendously demanding because each user will record and play back comments that must be saved and served quickly so that the content stays relevant.

This project came up as a suggestion from the book [Programming Phoenix] (https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix/programming-phoenix) and was developed along with its reading.
